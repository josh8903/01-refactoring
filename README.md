Refactoring Project

The purpose of this project was to refactor a given set of code to meet the following parameters:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Steps taken:
1) Added semantic HTML elements
2) Cleaned up HTML formatting
3) Added notes to HTML and CSS files
4) Removed redundant CSS coding
5) Reorganized CSS coding to follow HTML flow
